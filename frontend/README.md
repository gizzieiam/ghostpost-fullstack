## GhostPost

This project was base off of a frontend only project that I enjoyed so much I decieded to add on to it. In this Project I utilized my skills with Reactjs and RESTful APIs to interact with Python allowing users to make post anonymously, upvote and downvote on post. On the server side you can add and delete post.
